# Print you own enclosures

You can of course create your own casing. Or you can 3D print one of the versions I've put together. There are some different options, either one box for the whole kit including rechargeable battery. Or a separate smaller enclosure for the sensor components only, easier to place in the wheel well but it obviosuly necessitates a cable between the sensor and cpu/bluetooth unit.

Download STL files below if you want to 3D print or scrutinize the designs. 

If you or a friend have a 3D printer you can print them all yourself, otherwise there are numerous online print shops that will print and ship you the parts pretty cheap. I haven't used them myself but I got recommended www.3dhubs.com as an example.

## Print 

- The STL files are in millimeters  
- Choose 100um (0,1mm) layers  
- Preferably print in PETG  

## More designs

If you design your own case or make an updated variant of any of the 3D print downloads here please tell me (magnust@gmail.com), I'm sure there will be interest in your version too!

## Work in progress

_I'll update this page with more info as I come further with different mounting options and enclosures_

## Work in progress - Protection window

The protection window is still not 100% solved. A quick and dirty solution (no pun intended) is thin food wrap plastic over the sensors.     
The distance sensor works with many clear transparant plastics and glass but only if the window is flush mounted on the sensor itself. I'm looking at other ways of doing it.  
  
The temperature sensor works well with IR-transparent film mounted on the inside of the housing front. But these plastic films are not widely available. If you find a supplier please email me (magnust@gmail.com) so I can start making a list. I bought from KUBE Electronics AG in Switzerland (0,22mm opaque 2058)

# Complete electronics/sensors/rechargeable battery housing

Printable STL files:  
- <a href=printables/Main%20Housing%20Base.stl>Main enclosure</a>
- <a href=printables/Main%20Housing%20Lid.stl>Main enclosure Lid</a>  

- <a href=printables/Main%20Holder%20Base.stl>Holder unit</a>

You also need this for the adjustable hinge:  
- M3 x 6mm screw  
- M3 nut  
- 11mm washer  
- a few short bits of transparant filament can be used in the holes above the three LEDs to make them visible on the front panel,
