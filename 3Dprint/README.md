# Print you own enclosures

You can of course create your own casing. Or you can 3D print one of the versions I've put together. There are some different options, either one box for the whole kit including rechargeable battery. Or a separate smaller enclosure for the sensor components only, easier to place in the wheel well but it obviosuly necessitates a cable between the sensor and cpu/bluetooth unit.

Download STL files below if you want to 3D print or scrutinize the designs. 

If you or a friend have a 3D printer you can print them all yourself, otherwise there are numerous online print shops that will print and ship you the parts pretty cheap. I haven't used them myself but I got recommended www.3dhubs.com as an example.

## Print 

- The STL files are in millimeters  
- Choose 100um (0,1mm) layers  
- Preferably print in PETG or ABS  
- To see the LEDs telling you the that sensor is turned on or off print the housing part with white or translucent filament 

## More designs

If you design your own case or make an updated variant of any of the 3D print downloads here please tell us, pretty sure there will be interest for your version too!

## Work in progress
