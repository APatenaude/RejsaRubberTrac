# Print you own enclosures

You can of course just create your own casing. Or you can 3D print one of the versions I've put together. There are some different options, either one box for the whole kit including battery. Or a separate smaller enclosure for the sensor components only, easier to place in the wheel well but necessitates a cable between the sensor and cpu/bluetooth units.

All 3D print designs will be available for download. If you or a friend have a 3D printer you can print them all yourself, otherwise there are numerous online print shops that will print and ship you the parts pretty cheap. I haven't used them myself but I got recommended www.3dhubs.com as an example.



If you design your own case or make an updated variant of any of the 3D print downloads here please tell us, pretty sure there will be interest for your version too!



_This page will update with the different variants but just now there's only this_
