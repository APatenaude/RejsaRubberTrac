# RejsaRubberTrac
IR-sensor array + distance sensor with bluetooth BLE transmitter

Intended to track/view/logg tire temperatures on race- or trackday cars. The temperature is measured at sixteen different points over the full tire width.

A distance sensor is also included for tracking/logging suspension movements.

All data is available over bluetooth BLE.

Current code is for Adafruit's Bluefruit nRF52832 board.

The code for the IR temperature array sensor MLX90621 is 100% untouched from longjos https://github.com/longjos/MLX90621_Arduino_Camera which in turn is an adaption from robinvanemden https://github.com/robinvanemden/MLX90621_Arduino_Processing
